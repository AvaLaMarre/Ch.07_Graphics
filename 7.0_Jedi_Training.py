2. FLAG CREATION  (10PTS)
---------------
Make your flag 260 pixels tall
Use the scaling image on the website to determine other dimensions
The hexadecimal colors for the official flag are red: #BF0A30 and blue: #002868
Title the window, "The Stars and Stripes"
You can use a draw_text command and used 20 pt. asterisks for the stars.
We will have a competition to see who can make this flag in the least lines of code.
The record is 16! You will have to use some loops to achieve this.
CHALLENGE: Can you make the entire flag parametrically? This means if I change the hoist to 520px the flag will resize accordingly.
